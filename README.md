CellFlow - Modeling Complex Perturbations with Flow Matching
============================================================

CellFlow is a framework for predicting phenotypic responses of complex perturbations at the single-cell level.

## Example Applications

- Modeling the effect of single and combinatorial drug treatments
- Predicting the phenotypic response to genetic perturbations
- Modeling the development of perturbed organisms
- Cell fate engineering
- Optimizing protocols for growing organoids
- ... and more; check out the [documentation](https://cellflow.readthedocs.io) for more information.

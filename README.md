CellFlow - Modeling Complex Perturbations with Flow Matching 
============================================================

CellFlow is a framework for predicting single-cell phenotypes induced by complex perturbations. It is quite flexible and enables researchers to systematically explore how cells respond to a wide range of experimental interventions, including drug treatments, genetic modifications, cytokine stimulation, morphogen pathway modulation or even entire organoid protocols.


## Example Applications

- Modeling the effect of single and combinatorial drug treatments
- Predicting the phenotypic response to genetic perturbations
- Modeling the development of perturbed organisms
- Cell fate engineering
- Optimizing protocols for growing organoids
- ... and more; check out the [documentation](https://cellflow.readthedocs.io) for more information.

class JaxOutOfCoreTrainSampler:
    """
    A sampler that prefetches batches to the GPU for out-of-core training.

    Here out-of-core means that data can be more than the GPU memory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data
        The training data.
    seed
        The seed for the random number generator.
    batch_size
        The batch size.
    num_workers
        The number of workers to use for prefetching.
    prefetch_factor
        The prefetch factor similar to PyTorch's DataLoader.

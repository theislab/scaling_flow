CellFlow
=====================
.. module:: scaleflow

:mod:`scaleflow` is a framework for modeling single-cell perturbation screens. CellFlow is very flexible and enables researchers to systematically explore how cells respond to a wide range of experimental interventions, including drug treatments, genetic modifications, cytokine stimulation, morphogen pathway modulation or even entire organoid protocols.

:note: This is a work in progress. We are actively working on extending the documentation of :mod:`scaleflow` with more tutorials to cover a wide range of use cases. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us.
